# Crew Roster Optimization POC

This is a proof-of-concept for a crew rostering optimization system. It consists of a Python backend that handles the optimization logic and a React frontend for the user interface.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

- `frontend/`: A React application built with Vite that provides the user interface for interacting with the rostering system.
- `backend/`: A Python application that contains the core logic for data processing, rule enforcement, and roster optimization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (for the frontend)
- Python 3 and pip (for the backend)

### Installation

1.  **Frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Backend:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    python main.py
    ```
